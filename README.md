# Rancher Master Class: Terraform

This is the repository for the Rancher Terraform master class - if
anything is marked PRIVATE, it shouldn't be made public!

# Examples only - by default, not intended for direct use

> These are examples to show some useful patterns, and only if directly mentioned should they be
> considered for direct reuse.

I've learned a ton by refactoring Rancher's quickstart to fully use terraform, and then wanted to
learn more by giving a class on what I've learned (forcing me to learn even more). My experience is
in writing modules intended to fulfill a very direct purpose or with the intention of being reused.

Specicially, I have little experience in managing root modules - therefore, these are examples to
show some useful patterns, and only if directly mentioned should they be considered for direct
reuse.

## Documentation coming soon

I plan to condense this info into README files and Rancher blog posts, so keep an eye out for those
to give more context around this content.
